[quote=Thepuzzlegame]Love the new skin and all the new blocks! (also darnit! :P I was working on my own mod called score, ah well)[/quote]

Aww... sorry TPG. I know how that feels. That happens to me all the time. Actually... since you shared that with me, I will share this: 

This was originally called 'Slash', then I found a few lists of Scratch mods and saw it was taken (I think that was a 1.4 mod though). I couldn't find one called 'Score' and decided 'score' as a name fits a game mod [i]perfectly[/i]. So ready or not I hurried and put a post up about it (this topic just today) before anyone could claim the name - literally for that reason or I would have waited longer before showing other people what it is I've got lol. True story. I take naming things a little too seriously probably but sounds like I was right to worry ;) also, i have expertise in missed opportunities. So in a sense, my whole reason of posting this today was to beat you to the punch, without even knowing who "you" are. Today, I adopted something of an aggressive strategy on the name thing. My apologies, but 

Just to be clear, the reason for [i]this post[/i] is that I want something of a description of your experiences with Score if you'd be so kind. The reason for this post [i]going up today[/i] was a sudden (though apparently rational) fear of having to pick a name other than 'Score'. Otherwise I would have waited to add a few more features to make it seem more interesting.
